# 🛡️ DLL Loader for Windows Defender Bypass

This repository provides a **custom DLL Loader** built for **OSEP-level training and testing scenarios**. It executes DLLs directly in memory, avoiding disk writes and using stealth techniques to **bypass Microsoft Defender** and evade common AV/EDR solutions.

## 🎯 Purpose

This tool was created specifically as part of preparation for the **Offensive Security Experienced Penetration Tester (OSEP)** certification.

It has been **tested extensively in controlled environments**, and has proven to work effectively against **Windows Defender** in real-world lab conditions.

## 🧪 Use Cases

- OSEP lab exercises and red team simulations  
- Post-exploitation payload delivery  
- Execution of Mimikatz or custom tools as DLLs in memory  
- Bypassing AV/EDR during lateral movement
